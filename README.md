# Clustering

Using Yelp's datasets https://www.yelp.com/dataset applying **TF-IDF** to businesses:

- Implementing Clustering with **K-Means** and **Agglomerative clustering** (single link, complete link, average and ward), find out whether the clusters correspond or not to the categories using the confusion table, precision and recall metrics per cluster and in total

- It is possible that the texts are not clustered in a way that agrees with the categories, so using K-Means and Silhouette plot to find out.
